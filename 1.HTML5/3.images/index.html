        schedule with a maturity date specified in written contractual terms.[3][4][5] Law 122 stipulated that a
        depositor of gold, silver, or other chattel/movable property for safekeeping must present all articles and a
        signed contract of bailment to a notary before depositing the articles with a banker, and Law 123 stipulated
        that a banker was discharged of any liability from a contract of bailment if the notary denied the existence of
